Project Components

This project leverages the following fundamental concepts and technologies:

JDBC (Java Database Connectivity):
Employed for database operations, ensuring seamless interaction with the underlying database management system.
Sockets:
Facilitating communication and interaction between client and server components through network sockets.
Serialization:
Implementation for object serialization, enabling data transformation into a format suitable for transmission or storage.
Threads: (Not working)
Utilized for concurrent execution, ensuring optimized performance and parallel processing.
Email Functionality:
Integrated Java libraries to enable email functionality within the application, independent of dependency management through pom.xml.
This project amalgamates these core elements into a comprehensive system designed to manage user roles, medication inventories, and user-specific profiles within a secure and efficient environment.
